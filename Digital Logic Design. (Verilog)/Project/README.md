# Automatic Washroom System (Digital Logic Design)
In todayâ€™s world everyone is craving for a more relaxed, comfortable and a more automatic system to make their life easier.
Moreover, Statistics show that a washroom is one of the most hazardous places especially for older people. 
Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, 
making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. 
Therefore, we intend to make a washroom automation system which is not only automatic, but it also provides a safe and secure environment for older people.
